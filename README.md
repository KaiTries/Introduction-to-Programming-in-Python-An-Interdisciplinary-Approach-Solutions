# solutions-python
Hello World,

I am currently learning python with the book "Introduction to Programming in Python an interdisciplinary approach".
Since there are no solutions available online, I will upload mine here so that future readers of this book can use it if they are stuck.

I am a novice and my code is not perfect so bear with me.

If there already exists a solution to to exercise on the dedicated booksite https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/python/home/ i will just paste it in.
