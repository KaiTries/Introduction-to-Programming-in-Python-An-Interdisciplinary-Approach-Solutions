# solutions-python
Hello World,

I am currently learning python with the book "Introduction to Programming in Python an interdisciplinary approach".
Since there are no solutions available online, I will upload mine here so that future readers of this book can use it if they are stuck.

I am a novice and my code is not perfect but if it just helps one person im happy.
